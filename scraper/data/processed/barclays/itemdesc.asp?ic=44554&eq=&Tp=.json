Suitable for desktop motherboards utilizing the Intel 9x chipset and popular Small Form Factor (SFF) PCs including ultrabooks, notebooks, and tablets, the M.2 2280 SATA G2 SSD easily integrates into designs with M.2 connectors and is ideal for system builders and DIY end users.Lighter weight than a cased SSD, the M.2 SATA G2 SSD optimizes performance with advanced garbage collection, wear-leveling and TRIM support to keep performance consistent over the life of the drive. DevSleep, a recent addition to the SATA specification, is an efficient power management option that minimizes power consumption and extends battery life. Firmware-based power loss protection maintains data integrity and ensures data in cache is constantly flushed and hardened to NAND to enable the drive to recover in the event of an unsafe shutdown.SPECIFICATIONS > Form factor M.2 2280> Interface SATA Rev. 3.0 (6Gb/s) \u2013 with backward compatibility to SATA Rev. 2.0> Capacity 240GB> Baseline performanceSequential Read/Write SATA Rev. 3.0 Up to 550/330MB/sMax 4k Read/Write up to 100,000/80,000 IOPSRandom 4k Read/Writeup to 79,000/79,000 IOPSEndurance300TB and 0.70 DWPDPower consumption Max Read: 1.56WMax Write: 3.01WIdle: 0.06W> Storage temperature -40\u00b0C~85\u00b0C> Operating temperature 0\u00b0C~70\u00b0C> Dimensions 80mm x 22mm x 3.5mm", "catogory": "SSD"}
